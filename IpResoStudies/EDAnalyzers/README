--- Requirements to compile and run the code correctly:
-  the package is self-consistent in CMSSW_3_5_8 release

--- Description of the implemented classes:
Residuals.cc:
- evaluates d0 and dz for tracks wrt to refitted PV
- saves also pt,eta,phi,nHits and quality of the track for offline track selection 

VertexResponsesAndTrueResolutions.cc
- evaluates MC-based IP resolutions comparing recoTracks and TrackingParticles
- evaluates Vertex smearing effect on IP comparing prompt TrackingParticles and reco PVs

--- How to run the code:
- cmsRun test/residuals.py
- cmsRun test/respAndResoOnMC.py
